# PokéPlusPlus

A clone of Pokémon Red written entirely in C++ in order to run natively on PC without the use of emulators. This is starting as a project for a graphics class in university and I hope it grows considerably in the coming months!

I originally wanted to write Pokémon Emerald but it was far too much animation work to be feasible as a project for my class. Also, I won an award for this project!
