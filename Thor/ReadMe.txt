Thor C++ Library
================

Thor is an open-source and cross-platform C++ library. It extends the multimedia library SFML with higher-level features such as:

* Animations
* Particle systems
* Resource management
* Time measurement utilities
* Event handling and callbacks
* Delaunay triangulation
* Color gradients
* Vector algebra
* ...

For a full list of features as well as tutorials and API documentation, visit the project homepage at http://www.bromeon.ch/libraries/thor.

Thor is compatible with Visual C++, g++ and Clang compilers, as long as they provide at least partial C++11 support. Thor depends on the SFML and Aurora libraries; the latter is shipped in the SDK.
